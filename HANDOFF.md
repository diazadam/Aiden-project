- **Tested & Verified:**
  - Health endpoint (/api/health) returns provider status ✅
  - Static serving (/app/) with root redirect working ✅
  - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests ✅
  - Route separation prevents API/static conflicts ✅
  - Environment loading from project root .env.local ✅
- **Open questions:**
  - Ready to deploy to Replit for live testing with n8n integration?
  - Should we set up actual n8n instance for end-to-end workflow testing?
- **Next steps:**
  - Deploy to Replit and test live TaskCard generation/dispatch
  - Connect with actual n8n instance for complete automation workflow
  - Consider adding authentication/user management for multi-tenant use

### 2025-08-28 Cloud Integration Added
- **Branch:** master  
- **What I did:**
  - Built comprehensive Supabase client for server-side operations (tasks, conversations, bookings, kb_chunks)
  - Created GCS client with automatic service account materialization from base64
  - Extended host executor allowlist with 6 GCP commands (gcloud auth, run deploy, cloud build, gcs upload/download/list)
  - Added Google Cloud dependencies (storage 2.18.2, pubsub 2.31.1)
  - Updated environment variables for Supabase + GCP integration
  - Enhanced doctor script to check cloud service configurations
  - Created Supabase schema with proper indexes for performance
- **Why:** Enable Aiden/Jarvis cloud deployment, storage, and data persistence capabilities
- **Artifacts/Paths:**
  - libs/shared/supabase_client.py - Server-side Supabase REST client
  - libs/shared/gcs_client.py - Google Cloud Storage operations
  - ops/supabase_schema.sql - Database schema for tables
  - .env.local - Updated with GCP_PROJECT_ID and other cloud vars
  - Host executor now has 28 total commands (22 + 6 GCP)
- **Open questions:**
  - Ready to set up actual GCP service account for testing?
  - Should we create the Supabase tables or wait for production use?
- **Next steps:**
  - Test end-to-end: voice command → host executor → GCS upload
  - Wire cloud logging into terminal agent
  - Set up actual deployment pipeline for Cloud Run

### 2025-08-28 Host Bridge Added
- **Branch:** master
- **What I did:**
  - Built PIN-protected local host executor (apps/host/host.py)  
  - Created allowlist.yaml with 22 safe commands (apps, git, dev workflows)
  - Added dry-run mode and comprehensive error handling
  - Set PIN to 2188 as requested (updated from 4242)
  - Added execution logging to logs/host_executor.log for audit trail
  - Added make host-list command for easy command reference
  - Tested successfully: list, dry-run, actual execution, error cases
- **Why:** Enable Aiden/Jarvis safe control of Mac with explicit allowlist + PIN protection
- **Artifacts/Paths:**
  - apps/host/host.py - Main executor with PIN gate
  - apps/host/allowlist.yaml - 22 permitted commands
  - logs/host_executor.log - Execution audit trail (auto-created)
  - PIN changed from 4242 → 2188 in .env.local
- **Open questions:**
  - Ready to wire this into the terminal agent for voice/chat commands?
  - Any specific commands to add to the allowlist?
- **Next steps:**
  - Integrate host executor into aiden_pro.py for seamless control
  - Test end-to-end: voice → command → execution
  - Consider adding queue system for async operations

### 2025-08-28 Initial Consolidation
- **Branch:** main
- **What I did:**
  - Consolidated all scattered Aiden/Jarvis projects into single repo at ~/aiden-project
  - Moved AidenAlpha, JarvisCore, aiden_workspace, etc. to _archive/ (nothing deleted)
  - Created clean monorepo structure with apps/terminal/, libs/shared/, ops/n8n/
  - Built normalized terminal agent (aiden_pro.py) with chat/voice modes
  - Consolidated all API keys into .env.local (OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, Supabase, etc.)
  - Set up Python 3.11 venv with all dependencies
  - Created Makefile with simple commands: make run-chat, make run-voice
  - Added handoff kit for tracking changes
- **Why:** Adam requested consolidation to stop re-asking for API keys and have single source of truth
- **Artifacts/Paths:**
  - ~/aiden-project/ - main repo
  - ~/aiden-project/_archive/ - all old projects safely archived
  - apps/terminal/aiden_pro.py - main chat/voice agent
  - .env.local - all API keys consolidated
  - Makefile - simple run commands
- **Open questions:**
  - Should we add the optional host executor (apps/host/) next?
  - Any specific integrations to prioritize (n8n, Supabase features)?
- **Next steps:**
  - Test voice mode with ElevenLabs
  - Consider adding host executor for local commands
  - Set up any missing integrations from old projects

### 2025-08-28 n8n dispatcher + Control Tower alignment (Twilio later tonight)
- **Branch:** master  
- **What I did / current status:**
  - Control Tower (`apps/replit-mvp/main.py`) now wraps TaskCard under `body` and sends `X-Aiden-Token` to n8n.
  - Conversation memory persists to Supabase (`users.full_name` JSON) and is recalled in `/api/chat`.
  - Aiden Superintelligence path wired: if `business_name` + `industry` are provided, routes to specialized assistant.
  - n8n workflow in repo: `ops/n8n/aiden_sms_dispatcher.json` (Twilio node can stay disabled until creds are added).
- **Why:** Token-gated webhook + correct payload shape for reliable Control Tower → n8n dispatch; keep Twilio optional until configured.
- **Key code (already in place):**
```python
async def dispatch_to_n8n(card: TaskCard) -> tuple[int, str]:
    if not (N8N_URL and N8N_TOKEN):
        raise HTTPException(500, "N8N_URL or N8N_TOKEN missing")
    payload = {"body": json.loads(card.model_dump_json())}
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=20) as client:
        r = await client.post(
            f"{N8N_URL.rstrip('/')}/webhook/aiden-task",
            headers={"X-Aiden-Token": N8N_TOKEN, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
            json=payload,
        )
    return r.status_code, r.text[:1000]
```
- **Import + activate workflows via API:**
```bash
export N8N_URL=http://localhost:5678
export N8N_USER=admin
export N8N_PASS=admin123

# Aiden SMS Dispatcher
DISP_ID=$(curl -s -u "$N8N_USER:$N8N_PASS" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @/Users/adammach/aiden-project/ops/n8n/aiden_sms_dispatcher.json \
  "$N8N_URL/rest/workflows" | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')
curl -s -u "$N8N_USER:$N8N_PASS" -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"active":true}' "$N8N_URL/rest/workflows/$DISP_ID"

# (Optional) Incoming SMS Handler
INC_ID=$(curl -s -u "$N8N_USER:$N8N_PASS" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @/Users/adammach/aiden-project/ops/n8n/incoming_sms_handler.json \
  "$N8N_URL/rest/workflows" | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')
curl -s -u "$N8N_USER:$N8N_PASS" -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"active":true}' "$N8N_URL/rest/workflows/$INC_ID"
```
- **Token gate (required):** Set `N8N_TOKEN` in n8n env and in `.env.local` (Control Tower uses it via `X-Aiden-Token`).
- **Dry-run (before Twilio):** In n8n, disable the Twilio "Send SMS" node and connect the success response so webhook returns 200 without sending.
- **Smoke tests:**
```bash
# Direct to n8n
curl -s -X POST "$N8N_URL/webhook/aiden-task" \
  -H "X-Aiden-Token: $N8N_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"body":{"type":"send_sms","params":{"to":"+1TEST","body":"Dry run"}}}'

# Control Tower → n8n
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"taskcard":{"type":"send_sms","account_id":"ATOUCHOFHOPE","params":{"to":"+1TEST","body":"Dry run from Control Tower"}}}'
```
- **Supabase note:** Ensure `.env.local` has the active `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; memory then sticks across chats.
- **Port fix:** `lsof -ti tcp:8000 | xargs kill -9; make run-ctl`
- **Tonight (Twilio):** Add `twilio_main` credentials in n8n + set `TWILIO_FROM`, re-enable Twilio node, re-test the webhook.

### Jarvis Next — Phased plan (carry-forward)
- **Phase 1 — Bring automation online (today):**
  - Run n8n locally (Docker or native), set `N8N_TOKEN`, import/activate "Aiden Dispatcher".
  - Control Tower env: `N8N_URL=http://localhost:5678`, `N8N_TOKEN=<same>`; smoke test dispatcher.
- **Phase 2 — Memory (conversation persistence):**
  - Use Supabase `users.full_name` JSON for last 20 messages; verify recall in UI.
- **Phase 3 — Voice + Host bridge:**
  - Terminal agent voice fallback to macOS `say`; `!host run "<command>"` bridged to `apps/host/host.py` with PIN.
- **Phase 4 — First client preset (A Touch of Hope):**
  - Seed `accounts` + `kb_chunks`; add n8n FAQ + booking branches.
- **Phase 5 — Tests (must pass):**
  - n8n `/rest/ping` (or root), dispatcher active; Control Tower `/api/task` → n8n execution; memory persists; host commands work; voice fallback works.
- **Stretch:** `/api/n8n/sync` endpoint to install/upgrade dispatcher; re-enable `/api/task` PIN for prod.
