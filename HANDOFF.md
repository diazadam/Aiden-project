### 2025-08-28 Host Bridge Added
- **Branch:** master
- **What I did:**
  - Built PIN-protected local host executor (apps/host/host.py)  
  - Created allowlist.yaml with 22 safe commands (apps, git, dev workflows)
  - Added dry-run mode and comprehensive error handling
  - Set PIN to 2188 as requested (updated from 4242)
  - Added execution logging to logs/host_executor.log for audit trail
  - Added make host-list command for easy command reference
  - Tested successfully: list, dry-run, actual execution, error cases
- **Why:** Enable Aiden/Jarvis safe control of Mac with explicit allowlist + PIN protection
- **Artifacts/Paths:**
  - apps/host/host.py - Main executor with PIN gate
  - apps/host/allowlist.yaml - 22 permitted commands
  - logs/host_executor.log - Execution audit trail (auto-created)
  - PIN changed from 4242 → 2188 in .env.local
- **Open questions:**
  - Ready to wire this into the terminal agent for voice/chat commands?
  - Any specific commands to add to the allowlist?
- **Next steps:**
  - Integrate host executor into aiden_pro.py for seamless control
  - Test end-to-end: voice → command → execution
  - Consider adding queue system for async operations

### 2025-08-28 Initial Consolidation
- **Branch:** main
- **What I did:**
  - Consolidated all scattered Aiden/Jarvis projects into single repo at ~/aiden-project
  - Moved AidenAlpha, JarvisCore, aiden_workspace, etc. to _archive/ (nothing deleted)
  - Created clean monorepo structure with apps/terminal/, libs/shared/, ops/n8n/
  - Built normalized terminal agent (aiden_pro.py) with chat/voice modes
  - Consolidated all API keys into .env.local (OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, Supabase, etc.)
  - Set up Python 3.11 venv with all dependencies
  - Created Makefile with simple commands: make run-chat, make run-voice
  - Added handoff kit for tracking changes
- **Why:** Adam requested consolidation to stop re-asking for API keys and have single source of truth
- **Artifacts/Paths:**
  - ~/aiden-project/ - main repo
  - ~/aiden-project/_archive/ - all old projects safely archived
  - apps/terminal/aiden_pro.py - main chat/voice agent
  - .env.local - all API keys consolidated
  - Makefile - simple run commands
- **Open questions:**
  - Should we add the optional host executor (apps/host/) next?
  - Any specific integrations to prioritize (n8n, Supabase features)?
- **Next steps:**
  - Test voice mode with ElevenLabs
  - Consider adding host executor for local commands
  - Set up any missing integrations from old projects
