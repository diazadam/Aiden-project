# Security Policy

## AidenAI Security Framework

AidenAI Systems is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our proprietary AI technology. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and protection measures.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Framework

#### 1. **Safety Governor System**
- **Cost Controls**: Mandatory cost estimation with approval thresholds
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time risk factor identification and mitigation
- **Operation Validation**: Pre-execution safety checks for all operations
- **Automatic Rollback**: Failed operations trigger immediate cleanup

#### 2. **Capability-Based Security**
- **Permission System**: Skills declare required capabilities (`net`, `fs_read`, `fs_write`, `exec`)
- **Subprocess Isolation**: Skills run in isolated environments with resource limits
- **Network Restrictions**: Controlled network access with timeout controls
- **Error Containment**: Failures are isolated and don't affect system stability

#### 3. **Data Protection**
- **Credential Management**: Environment variable isolation and secure storage
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege

## üîí Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Security Updates |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Power-Stack v2.x | ‚úÖ | Active |
| Power-Stack v1.x | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Critical only |
| Legacy versions | ‚ùå | Unsupported |

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### How to Report Security Vulnerabilities

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

#### Secure Reporting Channels:

1. **Primary**: security@aidenai.systems
2. **Encrypted**: Use PGP key for sensitive reports
3. **Emergency**: For critical vulnerabilities affecting live systems

#### Required Information:
- **Vulnerability Type**: Classification (e.g., RCE, privilege escalation, data exposure)
- **Affected Components**: Specific modules, skills, or systems
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage and affected systems
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations
- **Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred timeline for public disclosure

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | 24 hours | 7 days |
| **High** | 72 hours | 14 days |
| **Medium** | 1 week | 30 days |
| **Low** | 2 weeks | 60 days |

## üèÜ Security Recognition Program

### Vulnerability Rewards
We acknowledge security researchers who help improve AidenAI security:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Recognition + potential bounty
- **Security improvements**: Contributor acknowledgment
- **Responsible disclosure**: Public recognition (with permission)

### Hall of Fame
Security researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities will be listed in our security acknowledgments (with their permission).

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
```bash
# Secure environment variables
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"  # Never commit to version control
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-key"  # Use service keys, not user keys
```

#### Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly
- **Access Logs**: Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications must use HTTPS

#### Skill Development
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and memory limits  
- **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Capability Principle**: Request minimal required capabilities

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```python
# Example: Secure skill implementation
class SecureSkill(Skill):
    caps = {"net"}  # Minimal capabilities
    
    def run(self, ctx: SkillContext, args: Inputs) -> Outputs:
        # Input validation
        if not self._validate_inputs(args):
            return Outputs(ok=False, message="Invalid input")
        
        # Resource limits
        with timeout(30):  # 30 second timeout
            result = self._safe_execution(args)
        
        # Output sanitization  
        return self._sanitize_output(result)
```

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output sanitization applied
- [ ] Resource limits configured
- [ ] Error handling secure
- [ ] Logging includes security events
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] No secrets in code or logs

## üö´ Security Limitations

### Current Limitations
We acknowledge these areas for improvement:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: Not all internal communications are encrypted
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Not yet implemented for all access points
3. **Runtime Security Monitoring**: Limited real-time threat detection
4. **Compliance Certifications**: Working toward SOC 2 and similar certifications

### Roadmap
- **Q1 2025**: Enhanced encryption and MFA implementation
- **Q2 2025**: Runtime security monitoring system
