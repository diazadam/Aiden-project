## 🚀 **HOW TO START AIDEN**

### **Method 1: Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Test all systems
python test_aiden_venv.py

# Launch client management
./aiden_venv/bin/python client_management_system.py

# Start complete system
./launch_aiden_venv.sh
```

### **Method 2: Direct Launch**
```bash
# Start SuperIntelligence
python superintelligence.py

# Test client management  
python test_client_management.py
```

---

## 💡 **NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION**

### **1. Add Production Credentials**
Edit `.env` file with your API keys:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid  
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
```

### **2. Start Client Onboarding**
```python
# Onboard your first client
from client_management_system import CLIENT_MANAGER

client_data = {
    "company_name": "Your Client Name",
    "industry": "hvac",  # or restaurant, healthcare, etc.
    "contact_name": "John Doe", 
    "email": "john@client.com",
    "phone": "+15551234567",
    "main_problem": "Missing too many calls - need automation"
}

result = await CLIENT_MANAGER.onboard_new_client(client_data)
```

### **3. Monitor Client Health**
```python
# Monitor all clients
health_results = await CLIENT_MANAGER.monitor_client_health()

# Get client dashboard
dashboard = CLIENT_MANAGER.get_client_dashboard(client_id)

# Get portfolio overview
overview = CLIENT_MANAGER.get_all_clients_overview()
```
