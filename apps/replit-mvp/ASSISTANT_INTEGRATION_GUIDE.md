# ðŸ¤– INTEGRATE YOUR OPENAI ASSISTANT WITH AIDEN

## Step 1: Get Your Assistant ID

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/assistants)
2. Find your assistant: `asst_mmCt54r7HpOgR5hQFaNhyDks` 
3. Copy the exact Assistant ID from the platform

## Step 2: Update the Code

Edit `superintelligence.py` line 45:

```python
# Replace this line:
self.existing_assistant_id = "asst_mmCt54r7HpOgR5hQFaNhyDks"

# With your correct assistant ID:
self.existing_assistant_id = "YOUR_ACTUAL_ASSISTANT_ID"
```

## Step 3: Use Your Assistant

### Option A: Use Your Assistant for All Conversations

Edit `main.py` line 309 to always use your assistant:

```python
# Replace this:
response_text = await AIDEN_SUPERINTELLIGENCE.business_conversation(
    business_key=business_key,
    message=body.message,
    context={"account_id": account_id}
)

# With this:
response_text = await AIDEN_SUPERINTELLIGENCE.business_conversation(
    business_key=business_key,
    message=body.message,
    context={"account_id": account_id},
    use_existing_assistant=True  # ðŸ‘ˆ This uses YOUR assistant
)
```

### Option B: Create a Direct Endpoint for Your Assistant

Add this to `main.py`:

```python
@app.post("/api/your-assistant")
async def your_assistant_chat(body: ChatIn):
    """Direct endpoint for your OpenAI Assistant"""
    account_id = body.account_id or "DEFAULT"
    
    # Use your assistant directly
    response_text = await AIDEN_SUPERINTELLIGENCE.aiden_core.use_existing_assistant(
        message=body.message,
        context={"account_id": account_id}
    )
    
    # Log conversation
    await sb_upsert_message(account_id, "user", body.message)
    await sb_upsert_message(account_id, "assistant", response_text)
    
    return ChatOut(assistant=response_text, taskcard=None)
```

## Step 4: Test Integration

Run this command to test:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python use_existing_assistant.py
```

## Step 5: Configure Your Assistant
