### 📍 **Access the Control Tower:**
1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8001`
2. You should see the enhanced Control Tower interface with new capability cards

### 🌐 **Testing Website Builder:**

1. **Enter Business Information:**
   - In the "Business Name" field, enter your business name (e.g., "My Amazing Business")
   - This is important for the AI to create personalized content

2. **Click the Website Builder Card:**
   - Look for the blue **"🌐 AI Website Builder"** card
   - Click the **"🌐 Build Website"** button

3. **Choose Website Type:**
   - A popup will appear asking for website type
   - Choose: `1` for Landing Page, `2` for Full Website, `3` for Blog, `4` for E-commerce

4. **Enter Domain (Optional):**
   - Enter a domain name like `myawesomebusiness.com` or leave blank for auto-generation

5. **Wait for Creation:**
   - The button will show "🏗️ Building..." 
   - After 10 seconds, you'll see "🧠 AI is designing your website..." with progress message
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for completion (it's generating complete HTML/CSS/JS!)

6. **View Results:**
   - The website code will appear in the chat interface
   - You'll see the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your website

### 🔍 **Debugging (If Needed):**

If nothing happens when you click the button:

1. **Open Browser Developer Console:**
   - Right-click → "Inspect" → "Console" tab
   - Look for any red error messages

2. **Check Console Logs:**
   - You should see: `🌐 Website Builder clicked!`
   - Then: `📡 Sending request to /api/create-website:` followed by data

3. **Watch for Progress:**
   - The button should change to "🏗️ Building..."
   - After 10 seconds: "🧠 AI is designing your website..."
   - Progress message should appear in chat

### ✅ **Expected Success Result:**
- Chat message: **"🌐 Website Created Successfully!"**
- Complete website code displayed
- Green success notification: "Your website has been created!"

### 🎯 **Test Other Features Too:**

- **🎓 Teach Aiden New Skills** - Train custom automation patterns
- **🎯 Custom Solutions** - Generate tailored automation solutions  
- **📊 Business Intelligence** - Get automation reports

### 🐛 **If You Encounter Issues:**

1. **Check Server Status:**
   - Ensure the server is still running in your terminal
   - Look for `INFO: Application startup complete.`

2. **Check API Key:**
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is set in `.env.local`
   - The website creation uses OpenAI to generate content

3. **Network Timeout:**
   - If it times out, the AI is still working - just took longer than expected
   - Try again with a simpler request (just "Landing Page")

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If the website builder isn't responding:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the server is running on port 8001
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is configured
4. Try refreshing the page and testing again

The website creation is working (as verified by our direct API tests) - any issues are likely related to browser timeouts or JavaScript errors that we can debug from the console output!
